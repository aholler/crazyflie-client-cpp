This is the source for a headless client for the Nanocopter Crazyflie
written in C++.

(C) 2014 Alexander Holler

It uses a heavily modified version of libcflie
(C) 2013 Jan Winkler

To build cfheadless you need cmake, git, gcc >= 4.7 and boost.

To checkout submodules (currently only libcflie) use:
git submodule init
git submodule update

Build the release-version:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
make

Build the debug-version:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug
make

To get a verbose output during compilation, use
VERBOSE=1 make

The client expects the configuration at the same place as it's binary.

That means just copy over the directory 'conf' from your Crazyflie Python
client to the directory cfheadless.cpp resides (or just create a symlink).


Be aware, if you distribute binaries of cfheadless, you have to add the
copyright from libcflie too.
